# density-dependent-IBM
The Matlab code for an individual based model of density-dependent movement in a population, supporting the paper:
'A computational study of density-dependent individual movement and the formation of population clusters in two-dimensional spatial domains.' Submitted to the Journal of Theoretical Biology

J.R.E. acknowledges support in the form of a Research Associateship from the School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham.

To run the code, open densitydependentRW.m
Here you can select parameters and choose whether to use a normal distribution or power law distribution as the dispersal kernel - comment out whichever you don't choose.
