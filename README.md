# density-dependent-IBM
The code for an individual based model of density-dependent movement in a population. The results have been submitted to the Journal of Theoretical Biology with the title: 'A computational study of density-dependent individual movement and the formation of population clusters in two-dimensional spatial domains.'

To run the code, open densitydependentRW.m
Here you can select parameters and choose whether to use a normal distribution or power law distribution as the dispersal kernel - comment out whichever you don't choose.
